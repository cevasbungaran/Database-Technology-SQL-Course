# Database Technology SQL Course
 
Final assignment for SQL Course.
We made a voting system for a (not real) talent show. We use dummy data for this assignment, and we build the system using SQL. We made 2 voting system, first one is by message and second one is from application. 

Not only a voting system, we made a system for manage the candidates, audition, and elimination. We created ERD first, make dummy data, and the last one is developed the stored procedure based on the ERD that we made.
